# Chore Sheet Generator

This unfinished project was the largest Java program I developed until [One Second](https://github.com/MattTheCuber/OneSecond). It had logging, used JavaFX for the GUI, and used SQLite for the database. Unfortunately, I never took screenshots :( It was developed in 2016 (age 12).
